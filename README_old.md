# dtoa Benchmark

## Preamble

This fork of the benchmark was created to demonstrate the performance superiority of my new `dtoa()` implementation over others.

[Ryū algorithm](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu) by Ulf Adams known to fastest in much cases, especially for short string representations. However, I would like to draw attention to my own speed-competing but more compact implementation.

Briefly, about this double-to-string implementation:

1. It is fastest Grisu-based, but not exactly the Grisu3 nor Grisu2;

2. Compared to Ryū this implementation significantly less in code size and spends less clock cycles per digit, but may slightly inferior in a whole on a 16-17 digit values.

3. Output string representation _always_ roundtrip convertible to the original value, i.e. `strtod()` for character string result will return the exactly original value.

4. Generated string representation is shortest for more than `99.963%` of
IEEE-754 double values, i.e. one extra digit for less that `0.037%` values.
Moreover, for less than `0.06%` of double values, the last digit differs
from an ideal nearest by `±1`.

5. For now produces only a raw ASCII representation, e.g. `-22250738585072014e-324` without dot and `'\0'` at the end;

Now I would like to get feedback, assess how much this is in demand and collect suggestions for further improvements. For instance, I think that it is reasonable to implement conversion with a specified precision (i.e., with a specified number of digits), but not provide a printf-like interface. For more into see [issue#1](https://github.com/erthink/erthink/issues/1).

Any suggestions are welcome!

## Introduction

This benchmark evaluates the performance of conversion from double precision IEEE-754 floating point (`double`) to ASCII string. The function prototype is:

~~~~~~~~cpp
void dtoa(double value, char* buffer);
~~~~~~~~

The character string result **must** be convertible to the original value **exactly** via some correct implementation of `strtod()`, i.e. roundtrip convertible.

Note that `dtoa()` is *not* a standard function in C and C++.

## Procedure

Firstly the program verifies the correctness of implementations.

Then, **RandomDigit** case for benchmark is carried out:

* Generates 2000 random `double` values, filtered out `+/-inf` and `nan`. Then convert them to limited precision (1 to 17 decimal digits in significand).

* Convert these generated numbers into ASCII.

* Each digit group is run for 10000 times. The minimum time duration is measured for 42 trials.

## Build and Run

1. Obtain [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Configure build system by running `cmake .` and build benchmark by running `cmake --build .`
3. On success, run the `dtoa-benchmark` executable is generated at `dtoa-benchmark/` or corresponding subdirectory (e.g `Release` on Windows).
4. The results in CSV format will be written to `dtoa-benchmark/results`.
5. Run GNU `make` in `dtoa-benchmark/results` to generate results in HTML.

## Results

The following are results measured by `RandomDigit` testcase on a PC (Core i7-7820HQ CPU @ 2.90GHz),
where `dtoa()` is compiled by GNU C++ 9.2.1 for x86-64 Linux.
The speedup is based on `sprintf`'s _Sum_ values.

## FAQ

1. How to add an implementation?

   You may clone an existing implementation file, then modify it and add to `CMakeLists.txt`.
   Re-run `cmake` to re-configure and re-build benchmark.
   Note that it will automatically register to the benchmark by macro `REGISTER_TEST(name)`.

   **Making pull request of new implementations is welcome.**

2. Why not converting `double` to `std::string`?

   It may introduce heap allocation, which is a big overhead. User can easily wrap these low-level functions to return `std::string`, if needed.

3. Why fast `dtoa()` functions is needed?

   They are a very common operations in writing data in text format. The standard way of `sprintf()`, `std::stringstream`, often provides poor performance. The author of this benchmark would optimize the `sprintf` implementation in [RapidJSON](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson/).
